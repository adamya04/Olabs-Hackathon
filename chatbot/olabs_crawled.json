The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.Right Circular CylinderSimulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present.

Traditional Lab?How do I register all my students to OLabs?What if I forget my password?Can the OLabs simulations be translated to other languages?What is OLabs?The OLabs hosts experiments in Physical, Chemical and Biological sciences for the students from classes 9 to 12 with content aligned toNCERT/CBSEand State Board Syllabus.\u00a0 The OLabs are hosted atwww.olabs.edu.in.\u00a0 Access to OLabs is free for Schools upon registration.How does the OLab work?The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science.\u00a0 This makes use of complex user-interactive simulations and detailed mathematical animations.\u00a0 OLabs combine technology resources, automation, along with tried and true training concepts.\u00a0 They are richly featured platforms and are meant to provide a compelling and personalized experience for learners, one that goes beyond just looking at content or interacting with simulations.\u00a0 They enable hands-on training whenever and wherever it\u2019s needed.How do I register to the OLabs?Refer the 'Registration' page.How much does it cost?Access to the OLabs is free upon registration.What syllabus do the OLabs cover?The OLabs learning platform has the labs curriculum-aligned toNCERT/CBSEand State Board Syllabus. However, students from ICSE and State boards will benefit as the topics covered across the boards are similar.What subjects are covered?The lab hosts experimentsin Physical, Chemical and Biological sciences for the students from classes 9 to 12. Recently OLabs has also included English and Mathematics lessons for Class 9 and 10.How often should I use OLabs?Ideally, we recommend that you use this program 2 times a week.How to start learning?To use OLabs login to the account you have been given through the sitewww.olabs.edu.in.A student can start with the Theory that gives an introduction to the experiment.The Procedure gives detailed step by step instructions on how to perform the experiment in a traditional lab and also using the simulator.The Animations help a student gain understanding of how to perform the experiment with hints, tool tips and so on, that show measurements, working of the equipment and other relevant information.The Video tab shows the video of the experiment as done in a traditional lab.The Simulation can be used to perform the experiment interactively. The experiment can be performed by clicking on the Simulation tab and following the step-by-step instructions as given in the \u2018Procedure\u2019 tab.A self-evaluation can be done through the Viva Voce module.\u00a0 This tracks what a student knows and has learned about a topic.\u00a0 It can be used before, during, and after performing the experiment. The data obtained from this module is logged for later analysis.The Resources tab provides information of the list of books, videos and links to sites that support the particular experiment content published on the OLabs website.\u00a0 Provided also is information to additional reading materials.Do I need Internet access to use OLabs?Yes, a DSL or other broadband connection speed of at least 256Kpbs is required.How does this learning program complement my schooling?The labs help students prepare themselves before attending a lab by becoming acquainted with the equipment, going through pre-lab exercises and taking pre-lab quizzes, both on the content of the work and on the safety considerations of the lab, all through online exercises.Who are the people behind OLabs?The OLabs is an educational initiative pioneered byAmrita CREATE, the Center for Research in Advanced Technologies for Education at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in partnership withCDAC, Mumbai; under a research grant from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.\u00a0 The lab hosts experiments in Physical, Chemical and Biology sciences which are developed by Amrita CREATE, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham for the students from classes 9 to 12 with content aligned toNCERT/CBSEand State Board Syllabus.\u00a0The Mathematics and English Lessons are developed by CDAC Mumbai.\u00a0 The OLabs are hosted atwww.olabs.edu.in.\u00a0 Access to OLabs is free for Schools upon registration.How do I contact the OLabs team?Please use the 'Contact Us' page and include your User ID in all your communications.How do we differ from other educational tools?OLabs can be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment are not available owing to being scarce or costly.\u00a0 This helps them compete with students in better schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances.\u00a0 The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through the OLabs, facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student\u2019s reporting and interpreting skills.What are the System Requirements for running OLabs simulations?Refer the 'Requirements' page.Can OLabs simulations be used on my tablet/iPad/Android devices?Yes, OLabs simulations can be used on tablet/iPad/Android devices.How do I restrict students from accessing websites other than OLabs in the computer lab?We recommend using a proxy server to manage the Internet in school lab.

lab experiments can be taught using the Internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being scarce or costly. This helps them compete with students in better equipped schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances. The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The features include :Content aligned to NCERT/CBSE and State Board Syllabus.Physics, Chemistry, Biology Labs from Class 9 to Class 12. English and Maths lessons for Class 9 and 10.Interactive simulations, animations and lab videos.The concepts and understanding of the experiment.The ability to perform, record and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime, and individualised practice in all areas of experimentation.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through OLabs facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student's reporting and interpreting skills.The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science. The labs make use of cutting edge simulation technology to create real world lab environments. Thorough study and research is done by research personnel for better understanding of the experimental procedures. Real lab scenarios are captured through live demonstration of the experiment so as to assimilate information on the procedures and lab equipment. Visualisation and development of the graphical symbols are done based on realistic situations and compared with the respective real equipment. Simulations are made interactive using various authoring tools, thus recreating and simulating a real lab environment.The OLabs are hosted atwww.olabs.edu.in. Access to OLabs is free for Schools upon registration.Teachers104107Schools21243Download OLabs android apphereSchools FeedbackStudents can access the lab activities at home as well & revise ~ Avijeet Sengupta, Mahaveer Public School Jaipur.\u2663It is good for students for visual learning.Good for the schools also ~ Rakesh Khandelwal, St.Mary's Convent Sr Sec School, Ajmer.\u2663Good to have virtual experiences of real lab experiments~Babu Lal Mali, Demonstration Multipurpose School, Ajmer.\u2663Many practicals of biology which cannot be performed in labs can be shown.Student can revise the experiments any time~Atul Rathi M.P.S, Ajmer.\u2663It helps to the teacher to explain the topic with an example or practical~Sunil Kumawat, Air force School, Jodhpur.\u2663Easy to approach~Satakshi Saxena, BVB Vidyashram Pratap Nagar Jaipur.\u2663Olabs Can help to understand concepts of mathematics better~ Gurvinder Kaur, India International School.\u2663For revision of practicals as taking to lab always may not be possible ~ Gurvinder Kaur India International School.\u2663It is very helpful for teachers as well as students for fruitful practical classes~Suraj Chandra Saha Garia Academy (Model), Assam.\u2663Online labs provide every student on opportunity to understand every detail relating to their subject matter taught to them in the schools.It enables them a deeper understanding~ Sujit Malakar, Dhamma Dipa School, Tripura.Featured SimulationProperties of acid and basesA simulation to study the properties of acids using HCl solution and bases using NaOH solution by their reaction with Blue and Red Litmus solutions, Zinc metal and Solid sodium carbonate.

Physical, Chemical and Biological sciences for the students from classes 9 to 12 with content aligned toNCERT/CBSEand State Board Syllabus.\u00a0 The OLabs are hosted atwww.olabs.edu.in.\u00a0 Access to OLabs is free for Schools upon registration.How does the OLab work?The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science.\u00a0 This makes use of complex user-interactive simulations and detailed mathematical animations.\u00a0 OLabs combine technology resources, automation, along with tried and true training concepts.\u00a0 They are richly featured platforms and are meant to provide a compelling and personalized experience for learners, one that goes beyond just looking at content or interacting with simulations.\u00a0 They enable hands-on training whenever and wherever it\u2019s needed.How do I register to the OLabs?Refer the 'Registration' page.How much does it cost?Access to the OLabs is free upon registration.What syllabus do the OLabs cover?The OLabs learning platform has the labs curriculum-aligned toNCERT/CBSEand State Board Syllabus. However, students from ICSE and State boards will benefit as the topics covered across the boards are similar.What subjects are covered?The lab hosts experimentsin Physical, Chemical and Biological sciences for the students from classes 9 to 12. Recently OLabs has also included English and Mathematics lessons for Class 9 and 10.How often should I use OLabs?Ideally, we recommend that you use this program 2 times a week.How to start learning?To use OLabs login to the account you have been given through the sitewww.olabs.edu.in.A student can start with the Theory that gives an introduction to the experiment.The Procedure gives detailed step by step instructions on how to perform the experiment in a traditional lab and also using the simulator.The Animations help a student gain understanding of how to perform the experiment with hints, tool tips and so on, that show measurements, working of the equipment and other relevant information.The Video tab shows the video of the experiment as done in a traditional lab.The Simulation can be used to perform the experiment interactively. The experiment can be performed by clicking on the Simulation tab and following the step-by-step instructions as given in the \u2018Procedure\u2019 tab.A self-evaluation can be done through the Viva Voce module.\u00a0 This tracks what a student knows and has learned about a topic.\u00a0 It can be used before, during, and after performing the experiment. The data obtained from this module is logged for later analysis.The Resources tab provides information of the list of books, videos and links to sites that support the particular experiment content published on the OLabs website.\u00a0 Provided also is information to additional reading materials.Do I need Internet access to use OLabs?Yes, a DSL or other broadband connection speed of at least 256Kpbs is required.How does this learning program complement my schooling?The labs help students prepare themselves before attending a lab by becoming acquainted with the equipment, going through pre-lab exercises and taking pre-lab quizzes, both on the content of the work and on the safety considerations of the lab, all through online exercises.Who are the people behind OLabs?The OLabs is an educational initiative pioneered byAmrita CREATE, the Center for Research in Advanced Technologies for Education at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in partnership withCDAC, Mumbai; under a research grant from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India.\u00a0 The lab hosts experiments in Physical, Chemical and Biology sciences which are developed by Amrita CREATE, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham for the students from classes 9 to 12 with content aligned toNCERT/CBSEand State Board Syllabus.\u00a0The Mathematics and English Lessons are developed by CDAC Mumbai.\u00a0 The OLabs are hosted atwww.olabs.edu.in.\u00a0 Access to OLabs is free for Schools upon registration.How do I contact the OLabs team?Please use the 'Contact Us' page and include your User ID in all your communications.How do we differ from other educational tools?OLabs can be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment are not available owing to being scarce or costly.\u00a0 This helps them compete with students in better schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances.\u00a0 The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through the OLabs, facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student\u2019s reporting and interpreting skills.What are the System Requirements for running OLabs simulations?Refer the 'Requirements' page.Can OLabs simulations be used on my tablet/iPad/Android devices?Yes, OLabs simulations can be used on tablet/iPad/Android devices.How do I restrict students from accessing websites other than OLabs in the computer lab?We recommend using a proxy server to manage the Internet in school lab.

The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.Right Circular CylinderSimulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present.

The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.Right Circular CylinderSimulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present. In the Present Perfect Continuous tense, the action has been taking place for some time and is still ongoing.

The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.Right Circular CylinderSimulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present. In the Present Perfect Continuous tense, the action has been taking place for some time and is still ongoing.

The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.Right Circular CylinderSimulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present. In the Present Perfect Continuous tense, the action has been taking place for some time and is still ongoing.

The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.Right Circular CylinderSimulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present. In the Present Perfect Continuous tense, the action has been taking place for some time and is still ongoing.

The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.Right Circular CylinderSimulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present.
